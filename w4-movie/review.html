                <em>Forrest Gump</em> has been my favorite movie for some time now. While technically categorized as a drama and romance, there are plenty of comedic moments in the movie as well. One of my favorite things about the movie is that it spans so many different aspects. There is sports, love, war, comedy, drama, pop culture, and historical references, just to name a few aspects the film covers.

                Tom Hanks does a fantastic job portraying the titular character, a 75-IQ boy growing up in Alabama through his young adult life. Follow Forrest as he struggles to make friends as a child due to his low IQ and leg "disability," where he befriends Jenny and they become inseperable in their childhood. Forrest attends college at Alabama and becomes a college football star due to his amazing running skill he developed miraculously after "breaking out" of his leg braces when being chased by bullies as a child. Forrest also gets drafted into the Vietnam War, where he earns the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery and saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. All the while, Forrest is longing for the love of his childhood friend Jenny. Somehow Forrest gets to meet two different US Presidents, plays on the National ping pong team, runs across the continental United States, captains a shrimping boat, and so much more. Will Forrest end up with Jenny in the end? Do yourself a favor and watch the movie to find out for yourself. Definitely 5 out of 5 stars and a must-watch.

                <h3>Trivia</h3>
               
                <ul>

                    <li>When Forrest gets up to talk at the Vietnam rally in Washington, the microphone plug is pulled and you cannot hear him. According to Tom Hanks he said, "Sometimes when people go to Vietnam, they go home to their mommas without any legs. Sometimes they don't go home at all. That's a bad thing. That's all I have to say about that."</li>
                    <li>Tom Hanks was not paid for this film. Instead, he took percentage points which ultimately netted him in the region of $40 million.</li>
                    <li>When Forrest first learns to play ping-pong in the infirmary, he is told the trick is to "keep his eye on the ball at all times" by another soldier. After that moment, whenever he is shown playing ping-pong, he never blinks.</li>
